	<h1>SUPERGRAPHIC PROJECT: QR CODE RIVER</h1>

	<div class="text">
		Supergraphics are large environmental graphics that usually run along walls and floors.<br>
		This work was done on a staircase at the Roski School of Art and Design at USC.<br>
		<p>
			I had the idea of music and the act of sharing music with others through a QR Code, and used pieces of QR Code as symbols of music to portray it flowing through the staircase.<br>
			The QR Code on the outside of the staircase leads to Odd Future's <i>Oldie</i>,
			which I thought was very fitting because of the nature of the song.<br>
			A group of artists gathering for a photoshoot, but made a music video.<br>
			For artists like Odd Future and students at Roski, it's sometimes all about coming together to just make something cool.
